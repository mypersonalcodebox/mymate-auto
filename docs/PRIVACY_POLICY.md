## Overview

MyMate is a personal AI assistant app for Android and Android Auto. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how we handle it.

## Data Collection

## Data Storage

**All your data stays on your device.** We use local SQLite database storage. Your notes, reminders, and parking locations are never uploaded to external servers.

### AI Processing

When you use voice commands or chat features, your messages are sent to your configured AI gateway (OpenClaw/OpenAI compatible) for processing. This connection is:
- Encrypted (HTTPS/WSS)
- Configured by you
- Under your control

We do not operate the AI backend - you connect to your own instance.
